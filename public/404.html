        <h1>Moving on…</h1>
        <p>Dear kochfokus.com users,</p>
        <p>for nearly two and a half years, we have run kochfokus.com as a place for people to share their favorite recipes, exchange tips about cooking and ask questions.
            We are incredibly grateful for everyone who contributed—be it by actually posting or just checking out the great content available here.</p>
        <p>We started this website as a spin-off of our founder Gabi's German blog <a href="https://kochfokus.de">kochfokus.de</a>, where she has been writing about cooking
            and baking for several years now. We decided to keep the brand but also allow other users to contribute, building a community around our shared interest. As it
            turned out, this might not have been quite the right choice. For one, while we saw a lot of people interested in Gabi's recipes, few of you wanted to chime in
            and post recipes yourself (we are even more happy about those of you who did, though!). In addition, as most of you naturally don't speak German, we saw a fair
            amount of confusion about our name kochfokus.com.</p>
        <p>So we have decided to reevaluate our approach and start anew. Thus, <a href="https://deliciouslygabi.com">deliciouslygabi.com</a> was born. Gabi has already started
            posting both new and old recipes there for a few months now and we would like to invite all of you to come and join us on that new adventure. The new website,
            <a href="https://deliciouslygabi.com">Deliciously Gabi</a>, will be a blog run by Gabi but any of you who want to interact, will still be able to do so via the
            comments. In addition, Gabi is very active on social media, so you will certainly find the opportunity to chat there.</p>
        <p>As a result of that, we have shut kochfokus.com down effective December 31, 2016. You will not be able to post new content or access previous posts.
            If you have any questions, we would love to answer them; just shoot us a quick message.</p>
        <p>Another huge thanks to all of you. We'll see you over at <a href="https://deliciouslygabi.com">Deliciously Gabi</a>!</p>
        <p>the kochfokus.com team<br>December 16, 2016</p>
